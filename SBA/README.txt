Character Database Management Draft 

Mock of the design of the database management front-end, with a home, register and login page. 

Home contains a mock of the initial page, with the search options (non-functional), and a table of possible search results. 

Registration takes in a name, email and password. Password must be 8-25 characters and contain a number and a letter. Input validation contained in javascript, redirecting users to the home page upon finishing.

Login takes in just an email and password, accepting only the default "fake@email.com" and "dontworry1" as the email and password respectively. Redirects users to home on success.
